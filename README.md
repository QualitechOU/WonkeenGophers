# Wonkeen Gophers

This repository contains some of the artwork created by Wonkeen.

Wonkeen is a new clothing brand by and for engineers. When we started this project some months ago, we decided to start creating unique products for developers and we 
believe that gophers are the perfect first approach for that.

We are a group of software engineers with strong, free, and open source values. For that reason, the content that you will find here is under an Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike Creative Commons license. 

If you like the idea and you want us to create more content you can support us at [wonkeen.com](wonkeen.com)
